<p><strong>Events Platform Back End</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>I developed a versatile platform for a small community business, allowing them to create and share events with local members. This platform enables community members to sign up for events and integrate them into their personal Google Calendar. Events can be free or paid, with payment options including set amounts or "pay what you feel."</p>
